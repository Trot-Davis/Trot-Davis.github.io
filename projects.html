            <h2>PCB NFC Business Card — Personal Project</h2>

            <p>I designed a fully custom NFC-enabled business card to share my professional details with a tap. I developed the Altium component libraries, schematic, and PCB layout, and designed a planar inductive antenna tuned to the NFC carrier to ensure resonance and reliable coupling. I modeled antenna geometry and trace parameters, then optimized inductance and Q using spreadsheet-based calculations shown above. Next steps are fabrication and firmware for the NFC controller.</p>

            <img src="State Machine RISC.png" alt="RISC Machine state machine" width="400">
            <p>I implemented a simple RISC processor in Verilog with instruction decode, a finite-state control unit, an ALU, and read/write data memory. I wrote testbenches and validated functionality in ModelSim, then synthesized to a DE1-SoC FPGA for on-board demonstration. Responsibilities spanned RTL design, datapath/control partitioning, and bring-up using Quartus. The project strengthened my digital design fundamentals and verification workflow.</p>

            <h2>Arcade Claw — Team Project</h2>
            <img src="APSCCLAW2.png" alt="Arcade claw" width="600">
            <p>I developed Arduino firmware to read a distance sensor and actuate a servo when a calibrated threshold was reached, implementing debouncing and timing safeguards for repeatable picks. I also supported the electrical subsystem—power distribution, cable management, and fault isolation—to ensure reliable operation during demos. The experience cemented my interest in embedded systems and hands-on hardware collaboration.</p>

            <h2>Reflow Solder Oven — Coursework</h2>
            <img src="Reflow Solder Oven.png" alt="Reflow solder oven hardware" width="600">
            <img src="Reflow Python 3.png" alt="Python plotting of oven profile" width="600">
            <p>I co-developed a two‑MCU reflow oven controller. The first Nuvoton MCU handled UI and control sequencing; I wrote the assembly for the finite‑state machine driving LCD updates and inter‑MCU signaling. I implemented timer‑driven PWM for the heating element and audible indicators. The second MCU executed the thermal profile—preheat, soak, reflow, and cool‑down—based on thermocouple feedback. We streamed data over serial to a Python script for live plotting and verification. I also contributed to wiring, integration, and system validation.</p>

            <img src="291car2.jpeg" alt="Coin-picking robot photo 2" width="600">
            <p>I built a small autonomous robot designed to detect and collect coins from the floor. I integrated sensor inputs for object detection and alignment, designed the motor control and power distribution, and wrote the embedded control logic to navigate, approach, and actuate a pickup mechanism. The project emphasized robust sensing under variable lighting, repeatable motion control, and mechanical‑electrical integration.</p>
