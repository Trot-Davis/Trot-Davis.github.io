            <p>This is the project that I'm currently working on. It's a PCB Business card that functions using NFC technology to share my LinkedIn profile as a unique way to network myself. So far, I've created an antenna that has sufficient inductance to ensure the business card is resonating with the NFC's frequency to allow fluent communication. These dimensions and sizing were optimized with the use of Excel as seen above. I have also fabricated both the schematic and PCB libraries in Altium, and designed the electronic schematic as well as layed out the components on the PCB board. All that's left to do is order the PCB and program the NFC chip!</p>

            <img src="State Machine RISC.png" alt="Project 1" width="400">
            <p> Created a simple RISC machine that can use read-write memory and perform arithmetic. It works by getting an instruction that gets decoded by the finite state machine, which then proceeds to the datapath. The desired value is computed using Boolean logic, as well as an ALU combinational logic block. From there, I stored the value in memory which can be used in the future. All of the code was done using Visual Studio Code, and was compiled on Quartus. I tested the program by making a testbench and running it in Modelsim to ensure the expected outputs were being output from the instruction that was sent in. I also loaded the program onto an FPGA board (The DE1-SOC) to demo the RISC machine in real life. This was one of my first experiences with hardware and verilog so it was a very enjoyable project for me!</p>

            <h2>Project 3: Arcade Claw - School Project</h2>
            <img src="RISC Machine.png" alt="Project 1" width="400">
            <p> This project holds a special plae in my heart as it was essentially the first real experience of electrical engineering, and it's what made me fall in love with the engineering field as a whole. Being apart of a hard working, dedicated team of multidisciplinary engineering students and getting to see a project you had been working hard on for months come together and function in front of you is an experience I will never forget, and will be one of my fondest early engineering moments. In terms of my role, I was tasked with making the arduino code that read a value from a sensor which triggered the rotation of a servo motor when a certain threshold distance fromn the ground was reached. I also helped the team with the circuitry of the claw, ensuring the claw was getting power and functioning properly. </p>
